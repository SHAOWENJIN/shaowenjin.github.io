<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a MSc Robotics student at the University of Manchester, with a background in Artificial Intelligence. I have focused my academic and practical efforts on the development of "Intelligent Environments". This path included my bachelor's thesis, Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Photovoltaic Power Generation, and was reinforced by an electronic internship in the energy sector.

My goal is to forge a career as an engineer who creates tangible solutions at the nexus of machine intelligence, particularly within the energy.

[Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Photovoltaic Power Generation](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/Deep-Learning-Based-Prediction-of-Photovoltaic-Power-Generation.git)</div>
- Outstanding Graduation Thesis. 
- As the depletion of fossil fuels accelerates the transition to renewable energy, accurate photovoltaic (PV) power prediction becomes crucial for grid stability. Existing methods often fail to capture the periodicity and long-term dependencies in power generation data. To address this, I propose a CNN-LSTM deep learning model. It processes data using PCA for dimensionality reduction, employs CNN to extract local temporal features, and utilizes LSTM to learn long-term patterns. Validated on a U.S. PV plant dataset, our model outperforms CNN, LSTM, and XG_BOOST benchmarks, achieving the lowest MAE (134) and RMSE (289).

[Computer Vision Application Real vs. AI Detection](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/Computer-Vision-Application-Real-vs.-AI-Detection.git)</div>
Presents an AI-generated image detection algorithm focused on texture features. By converting original images into line drawings, the model effectively captures edge texture characteristics (e.g., smoother transitions in AI images vs. distinct separation in real images), avoiding redundant information interference. Preprocessing employs a grayscale- and gradient-based reconstruction method to maximize retention ofÁ´ã‰Ωì depth features, supplemented by Gaussian denoising similarity comparison as an auxiliary screening step. The backbone network utilizes EfficientNetV2, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to achieve an optimal balance between parameter size and computational efficiency, delivering top-tier performance on ImageNet. The model is converted to ONNX format, boosting inference speed by approximately 40% while enhancing cross-platform compatibility.

[STM32F103CBT6_Item](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/STM32F103CBT6_Item.git)</div>
This STM32-based project demonstrates full-stack embedded development. I independently designed the circuit and PCB (recognized with engraved naming), programmed in embedded C using Keil, and configured peripherals via STM32CubeMX. Implemented features include LED matrix display, PWM dimming, buzzer audio, UART communication, and RTOS multitasking. Debugging hardware issues enhanced my interface programming and system integration capabilities.

[LeNet-based Object Classification](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/LeNet-based-Object-Classification.git)</div>
This project implements CIFAR-10 image classification using LeNet-5. The architecture alternates convolutional layers (extracting local patterns) with pooling layers (reducing dimensionality), followed by fully connected layers with ReLU activation for classification. The experiment involved model construction, training with parameter adjustment, and performance validation on test data.

[Kmeans_PSO](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/Kmeans_PSO.git)</div>
This study applies Particle Swarm Optimization to codebook design in speech recognition. The method clusters speech feature vectors into codewords, with each particle representing a candidate codebook. Through iterative updates of particle positions and velocities using the inverse intra-class dispersion as the fitness function, it maximizes inter-class distance to enhance codebook quality. Key parameters employ nonlinear adjustment strategies: inertia weight balances global/local search, while learning factors coordinate individual/collective experience. This approach effectively improves encoding efficiency and decoding accuracy in vector quantization.

[Robotic Systems for Sustainable Development](https://youtu.be/32iZ6pw9bB8)

A sustainable future means achieving shared prosperity within our planet's ecological limits. Industrial robots boost productivity while service robots assist human tasks, advancing UN Sustainable Development Goals across multiple sectors. Solar panel cleaning robots exemplify this impact‚Äîusing sensor fusion and water-free technology to cut costs by 85% and increase energy output. This transformation elevates technicians into robotics managers and data analysts, harnessing AI rather than competing with machines.
