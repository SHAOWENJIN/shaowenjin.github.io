<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a MSc Robotics student at the University of Manchester, with a background in Artificial Intelligence. I have focused my academic and practical efforts on the development of "Intelligent Environments". This path included my bachelor's thesis, Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Photovoltaic Power Generation, and was reinforced by an electronic internship in the energy sector.

My goal is to forge a career as an engineer who creates tangible solutions at the nexus of machine intelligence, particularly within the energy.

[Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Photovoltaic Power Generation](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/Deep-Learning-Based-Prediction-of-Photovoltaic-Power-Generation.git)
- Outstanding Graduation Thesis. 
- As the depletion of fossil fuels accelerates the transition to renewable energy, accurate photovoltaic (PV) power prediction becomes crucial for grid stability. Existing methods often fail to capture the periodicity and long-term dependencies in power generation data. To address this, I propose a CNN-LSTM deep learning model. It processes data using PCA for dimensionality reduction, employs CNN to extract local temporal features, and utilizes LSTM to learn long-term patterns. Validated on a U.S. PV plant dataset, our model outperforms CNN, LSTM, and XG_BOOST benchmarks, achieving the lowest MAE (134) and RMSE (289).

[Computer Vision Application Real vs. AI Detection](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/Computer-Vision-Application-Real-vs.-AI-Detection.git)
- Presents an AI-generated image detection algorithm focused on texture features. By converting original images into line drawings, the model effectively captures edge texture characteristics (e.g., smoother transitions in AI images vs. distinct separation in real images), avoiding redundant information interference. Preprocessing employs a grayscale- and gradient-based reconstruction method to maximize retention ofÁ´ã‰Ωì depth features, supplemented by Gaussian denoising similarity comparison as an auxiliary screening step. The backbone network utilizes EfficientNetV2, optimized via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to achieve an optimal balance between parameter size and computational efficiency, delivering top-tier performance on ImageNet. The model is converted to ONNX format, boosting inference speed by approximately 40% while enhancing cross-platform compatibility.

[LeNet-based Object Classification](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/LeNet-based-Object-Classification.git)
- This projects implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the LeNet-5 architecture. The network employs alternating convolutional and pooling layers to extract hierarchical features: convolutional layers capture local patterns through sliding kernels, while pooling layers reduce dimensionality and computational load. Classification is performed via fully connected layers, with ReLU activation functions enabling nonlinear modeling. The experiment comprises three phases: constructing the LeNet-5 architecture with forward propagation; training on CIFAR-10 while adjusting sample size and iteration counts, with model parameters saved for reuse; and evaluating accuracy on test sets and custom images to validate classification performance.

[Kmeans_PSO](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/Kmeans_PSO.git)
- This study applies Particle Swarm Optimization to codebook design in speech recognition. The method clusters speech feature vectors into codewords, with each particle representing a candidate codebook. Through iterative updates of particle positions and velocities using the inverse intra-class dispersion as the fitness function, it maximizes inter-class distance to enhance codebook quality. Key parameters employ nonlinear adjustment strategies: inertia weight balances global/local search, while learning factors coordinate individual/collective experience. This approach effectively improves encoding efficiency and decoding accuracy in vector quantization.

[STM32F103CBT6_Item](https://github.com/SHAOWENJIN/STM32F103CBT6_Item.git)
- This project based on the STM32 microcontroller, demonstrates comprehensive embedded system development capabilities. On the hardware side, I independently designed the circuit schematic and PCB layout, with my name engraved on the microcontroller board in recognition of outstanding design. For software development, embedded C programs were written using Keil uVision5, with peripherals including GPIO, UART, and timers configured graphically via STM32CubeMX. Implemented features include LED matrix dynamic display, PWM breathing lights, buzzer music playback, UART communication, and RTOS multitasking. Practical issues such as GPIO configuration errors were resolved through debugging, enhancing hardware interface programming and system integration skills.
