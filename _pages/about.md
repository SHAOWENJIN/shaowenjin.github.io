<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a MSc Robotics student at the University of Manchester, with a background in Artificial Intelligence. I have focused my academic and practical efforts on the development of "Intelligent Environments". This path included my bachelor's thesis, Deep Learning-Based Prediction of Photovoltaic Power Generation, and was reinforced by an electronic internship in the energy sector.

My goal is to forge a career as an engineer who creates tangible solutions at the nexus of machine intelligence, particularly within the energy.
